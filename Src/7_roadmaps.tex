In the short term, as the country develops, more energy-intensive devices will be used, and electronic devices will go from luxury to necessity. Higher energy demand will require a more reliable power supply with higher peak power capabilities. A short-term solution is to use a battery to store energy, providing reserves for cloudy days and higher burst power.


In 2021, the first Grid-connected solar photovoltaic power plant was announced \cite{solarfar}; however, there is still no progress on this project. The 50 Mw solar farm would produce an expected 91.6 GWh of electricity annually, significantly contributing to the country's net electricity supply.
