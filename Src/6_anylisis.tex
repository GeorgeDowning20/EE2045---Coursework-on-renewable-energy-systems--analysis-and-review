Initiatives such as OXFAM supply solar panels to Tanzania villages \cite{oxfam}. Individual panels for homes provide lighting and charging for electronics. Solar-powered water pumps are being installed to reduce the walk to the water. All significantly improving the quality of life for many Tanzanians. While the direct impact of such initiatives is difficult to qualify, the economy is one of the fastest growing in Africa, projected to be as high as +8\% GDP growth per year, suggesting the result of all initiatives is accelerating the growth of the economy into the modern era.
